        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This tofu veggie stir-fry is quick and easy, making it a great go-to weeknight meal. 
            Baked tofu has a firm, toothsome texture that crisps well in a hot pan. You can find 
            it in flavors like teriyaki and sesame, both of which are delicious here. Or opt 
            for a smoked version, which has the same texture with a more robust flavor. Serve 
            over brown rice.
        </p>
